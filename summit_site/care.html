                <h3>TRAINING</h3>
                <p>
                    A critical part of raising a Husky is training them. You must begin training your dog (no matter at what age you adopt them) starting from day one. You’d be amazed at how quickly pups can pick up on poor habits and then how long it takes to fix those habits. Plus, Huskies can be bullheaded and independent, so they must know you are in charge. Otherwise, they will undoubtedly take the lead.

                    To help keep your Husky entertained, training should be a fun and exciting activity. Try using positive reinforcement and breaking up training with a fun run around the yard or a game of fetch. Keep in mind that training your dog is an ongoing process, so patience will be a valuable virtue. By remaining consistent and committed with your training, your Husky will soon enough catch on to all their new commands and tricks.

                    An implemental part of training your Alaskan Husky is to also work on their socialization. This can include taking your pal to new places (i.e., parks, restaurants, dog-friendly stores) and introducing them to new people, dogs, sights, sounds, and smells. Just like training, socialization is an ongoing process that should ideally begin right after bringing your dog home. Fortunately, socialization opportunities exist all around us, and they can help our best buds have a friendly temperament and well-rounded personality.

                <h3>GROOMING</h3>
                <p>
                    Step 1: Brushing your husky Brushing your husky, the good news is, huskies need less grooming than many other double-coated dogs. The most critical step to maintaining your husky’s coat is regular, thorough brushing. You should aim at least once a week. Your brush pattern should begin with the undercoat; brush thoroughly away from the skin to remove loose hairs. Move on next to the overcoat – brush vigorously in the direction of the hair growth to encourage shine and smoothness. Pay special attention to any mats or tangles, loosening with conditioner if necessary.

                    Step 2: Look out for shedding When the weather begins to warm up, your Siberian husky will start to shed— a lot. This process is a slow one, but more frequent brushing can speed it up and keep your dog’s fur from matting and tangling. It will also reduce the number of weeks you spend following your dog around with the vacuum cleaner. Using the same technique as the rest of the year, aim to brush your husky every day if possible. You may want to invest in an “undercoat rake” that’s specifically designed to remove the dead hair under his topcoat more effectively. As he sheds his underlayer in preparation for warm weather, the hair needs to be removed for new hair to grow correctly.

                    Step 3: Bathing and fur removal The good news is your Siberian husky never needs to have his fur clipped by a groomer. He will naturally shed and re-grow his coats based on the temperature he lives in, and his hair will fall out before it gets too long. Because huskies don’t produce an excess of oil, they don’t need to be bathed all that often. Aim for once a month or less, only bathing when your pup starts to smell, or his hair begins to mat. If you do bathe your husky, be sure to rinse his coat thoroughly as its thickness is a magnet for leftover shampoo and conditioner. When your dog gets wet or otherwise dirty, be sure to brush out clumps and matting immediately to avoid a painful, hard-to-handle mess later.

                <h3>HEALTH / NUTRITION</h3>
                <p>
                    Counting Calories Husky feeding confusion revolves around what a high versus low-calorie diet means, and around the difference between a working breed and a working dog. Huskies were bred over hundreds of years to work hard in very extreme environmental conditions. These guys were developed by native Arctic peoples to run long distances while pulling loads in brutal winters. They had to do this while eating the food that was available in that environment -- small amounts of very densely concentrated animal protein and fat. Your husky needs a very small amount of food per day compared to dogs of similar size, usually only 1 1/2 to 2 cups of kibble or a specially formulated raw diet. But this food must be of superior quality to meet your husky's needs.

                    Protein And Fat Ideal husky diets are almost entirely animal protein and fat. Dogs, in general, need very little carbohydrate and huskies need almost none. Some breeders and husky enthusiasts point out that huskies eat some plant matter (such as berries and roots) in their native environment during the spring and summer and recommend feeding these occasionally. Other than fruit and veggie treats, your husky's food should contain only meat -- including organ meat -- fat and bone meal. A guide to reading pet food labels, such as the one published by the FDA, can help you decipher the ingredients in your doggy's chow. Working Dog Or Couch Potato? Huskies are very efficient at converting calories to energy, and as their activity level decreases from their working heritage, so does their caloric need. Consult your veterinarian about the ideal weight for your dog and feed accordingly. You will probably find that your pup needs a surprisingly small amount of food and a large amount of exercise to keep in shape.

                    Zinc Huskies are prone to a skin condition called zinc responsive dermatosis. The condition is usually inherited in this breed, but it can also be the result of too little or too much zinc while your dog is still growing (it is important to feed high-quality food and avoid unnecessary supplements from day one). If your dog is diagnosed with the familial form of this disease, you'll have to feed a high zinc diet. You can do this by adding supplements or by making a high zinc raw diet. Either should be done only under the guidance of a veterinarian. The USDA's Nutrient Database can help you choose high zinc foods and treats for your pup.
