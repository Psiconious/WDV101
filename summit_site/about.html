                <h3>Alaskan Huskies are like Siberian Huskies</h3>
                <p>
                    Alaskan Huskies and Siberian Huskies share so many striking resemblances, they are often thought to be the same. Someone who doesn’t know much about dogs will assume they are the same breed. However, they have their differences. Alaskan Huskies are slimmer and have different eye colors. The Siberian Husky is also a recognized purebred by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and other popular Kennel Clubs while his Alaskan brother is a crossbreed and unrecognized.
                </p>
                <h3>They are highly energetic</h3>
                <p>
                    The energy level of the Alaskan Husky is so high, he is termed the Siberian Husky on steroids. This energy enabled them to go about their initial occupation of sledding across a long distance. Their energy level makes them a handful today. Make sure they use it up exercising or you’d have a hyper case in your hands.
                </p>
                <h3>They were bred to be sled dogs</h3>
                <p>
                    Sled dogs were trained to pull sleds in harnesses. They were used often in cold climates, that’s why many of them cope with the winter. The Alaskan Husky was one of such dogs. They pulled sled over long distances, way before they became household companions.

                <h3>They are known for their speed</h3>
                <p>
                    Alaskan Huskies were bred to be a more energetic version of the Siberian Husky. This energy makes them fast—a quality that made them excellent sled dogs. They were often used in sled races thanks to their speed.
                </p>
                <h3>Technically speaking, Alaskan Husky is a type, not a breed</h3>
                <p>
                    In its primary sense, the term ‘Alaskan Husky’ categorizes a good number of Huskies. The same controversy exists with other dog names like the Pit Bull. There is a crossbreed of various fast dogs called the Alaskan Husky. It is what we are focused on. Nevertheless, the Alaskan Husky is not recognized as a breed by any Kennel Club.
