            <p>Cocoa as of now is primarily used as a confectionery treat. However cocoa does have more medical uses and health benefits and in recent year molecular research has been made mapping those benefits in human. In opposition of what many may believe about cocoa, cocoa can actually help in weight loss, can aid in muscle glucose uptake, offering neuron protection, enhances cognitive function, and helps generate positive moods. It can also surpress immunoglobulin E release in allergic responses.</p>
