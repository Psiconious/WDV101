                    <h2>Lyrilusc Berly Canary</h2>
                    <p>Lyrilusc Berly Canary is based off the real world bird, canary, and the real world mineral, berly.</p>
                    <h3>Canary</h3>
                    <p>
                        The wild canary is a small finch that is native to the Macaronesian islands of the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. Bred in captivity since the 17th century, the bird arrived in Europe by way of Spanish sailors after the conquest of the Macaronesian islands. The canaries sold in pet stores are now genetically quite different from their wild canary ancestors.
                        Canaries readily breed with other species of finches. This hybridization yields unique canaries. For example, red canaries resulted from the breeding of domestic canaries with red siskins, a South American finch.

                    <h3>Berly</h3>
                    <p>
                        A relatively rare silicate mineral with a chemical composition of Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>.  It is found in <a href="https://geology.com/rocks/igneous-rocks.shtml">igneous</a> and <a href="https://geology.com/rocks/metamorphic-rocks.shtml">metamorphic rocks</a> in many parts of the world.

                    <h2>Lyrilusc Celestine Wagtail</h2>
                    <p>Lyrilusc Celestine Wagtail is based off the real world bird, wagtail, and the real world mineral, Celestine.</p>
                    <h3>Wagtail</h3>
                    <p>
                        are a group of passerine birds that form the genus Motacilla in the family Motacillidae. The forest wagtail belongs to the monotypic genus Dendronanthus which is closely related to Motacilla and sometimes included therein. The common name and genus names are derived from their characteristic tail pumping behaviour. Together with the pipits and longclaws they form the family Motacillidae. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Celestine</h3>
                    <p>
                        An attractive mineral that forms in well-shaped crystals with a distinctive soft blue color. Crystals may be a solid color, but may also have lighter and darker color zones of blue. While pure Celestine is colorless, various impurities give this mineral a wider range of colors, especially its celestial blue color. Celestine geodes of large, deep sky-blue crystals are well-known and abundant from Madagascar.

                    <h2>Lyrilusc Cobalt Sparrow</h2>
                    <p>Lyrilusc Cobalt Sparrow is based off the real world bird, sparrow, and the real world mineral, cobalt.</p>
                    <h3>Sparrow</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sparrows are a wide bird category this card in particular is based off the old world sparrow. Old World sparrows are a group of small passerine birds forming the family Passeridae. They are also known as true sparrows, a name also used for a particular genus of the family, Passer. They are distinct from both the New World sparrows, in the family Passerellidae, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the Java sparrow of the family Estrildidae. Many species nest on buildings and the house and Eurasian tree sparrows, in particular, inhabit cities in large numbers. They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like gulls or pigeons, will eat small quantities of a diversity of items. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cobalt</h3>
                    <p>
                        A chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal. Cobalt-based blue pigments have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was for a long time thought to be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore for some of the blue-pigment-producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted

                    <h2>Lyrilusc Sapphire Swallow</h2>
                    <p>Lyrilusc Sapphire Swallow is based off the real world bird, swallow, and the real world gem, sapphire.</p>
                    <h3>Swallow</h3>
                    <p>
                        A family of passerine birds found around the world on all continents, including occasionally in Antarctica. Highly adapted to aerial feeding, they have a distinctive appearance. The term "swallow" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. Around 90 species of Hirundinidae are known, divided into 19 genera, with the greatest diversity found in Africa, which is also thought to be where they evolved as hole-nesters. They also occur on a number of oceanic islands. A number of European and North American species are long-distance migrants; by contrast, the West and South African swallows are nonmigratory.
                        This family comprises two subfamilies: Pseudochelidoninae (the river martins of the genus Pseudochelidon) and Hirundininae (all other swallows, martins, and saw-wings). In the Old World, the name "martin" tends to be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name "swallow" for the more fork-tailed species; however, this distinction does not represent a real evolutionary separation.

                    <h3>Sapphire</h3>
                    <p>
                        A precious gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum, consisting of aluminium oxide with trace amounts of elements such as iron, titanium, chromium, vanadium, or magnesium. The name sapphire is derived from the Latin "saphirus" and the Greek "sapheiros", both of which mean blue. It is typically blue, but natural "fancy" sapphires also occur in yellow, purple, orange, and green colors; "parti sapphires" show two or more colors. Red corundum stones also occur, but are called rubies not sapphires

                    <h2>Lyrilusc Turquoise Warbler</h2>
                    <p>Lyrilusc Turquoise Warbler is based off the real world bird, warbler, and the real world gem, turquoise.</p>
                    <h3>Warbler</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like sparrows warblers come in different varities and are split between new world and old world. Lyrilusc Turquoise Warbler is based on the new world warbler. The New World warblers or wood-warblers are a group of small, often colorful, passerine birds that make up the family Parulidae and are restricted to the New World. They are not closely related to Old World warblers or Australian warblers. Most are arboreal, but some, like the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are primarily terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Turquoise</h3>
                    <p>
                        An opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrated phosphate of copper and aluminium. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gemstone and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue. Like most other opaque gems, turquoise has been devalued by the introduction of treatments, imitations and synthetics into the market. The robinâ€™s egg blue or sky blue color of the Persian turquoise mined near the modern city of Neyshabur in Iran has been used as a guiding reference for evaluating turquoise quality.
