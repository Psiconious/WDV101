    <h1>Wind Energy</h1>

    <p>Through history, wind power has been used from the wind mills of old to the high tech wind turbines seen on farms today.</p>
    <p>In the us, in 1850 Daniel Halladay and John burnham started the U.S. Wind Enegine Company. In the 1890's wind power is being used to pump water for irrigaion and windmills generate electricity for homes and businesses. During this time steel blades are invented for the windmill making them more efficent. In 1941 the largest turbine of the time,<em><strong> Grandpa's Knob</strong></em>, powers local utility network for serveral months. During the 1970's due to skyrocketing oil prices interest and research into wind turbines grow.</p>
    <p> In 1978 <em>the president</em> signed a bill requiring companies to purchace electricity from renewable energy sources. 1980, the first large wind farm is installed in California. In 2012, U.S. wind energy capacity reaches 60 Gigawatts. 2013, the first offshore wind turbine is constructed. In 2016, wind turbine service tech named the fastest growing job of the decade. Also in 2016, first offshore wind farm is constructed. Finally in 2019, US capacity surpasses 100 gigawatts.</p>
    <p><strong>Wind Turbine Fun Facts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wind turbines can have as many as 8000 parts.</li>
        <li>An average turbine blade is 200ft long and turbine towers stand at average 295ft.</li>
        <li>Wind turbine manfacuturing is the most american job.</li>
        <li>Wind turbines are noisy and can be physically and psychologically dangerous to those living nearby.</li>
